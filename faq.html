</div>


<div id="type_of_payment">


<h5>What types of payment plans are available for the properties under construction?</h5>
<p>
The contemporary sales and financing catalogue for the payment of the assets include various options. Choosing the most convenient and profitable plan significantly depends on the availability of cash in hand and the norms of the plan to be borne by the home buyer. Listed below are few of the most prevalent payment options which are operational in the Indian real estate market:<br /><br />

1)  Construction linked plan: Popularly termed as CLP, the construction linked plan warrants the payments to be made in tandem to the predetermined stages of property construction. As the property develops/floors get constructed in a project, the buyers are expected to pay the developer, segments of the total price consented upon and mentioned in the builder-buyer agreement. <br /><br />

2)  Time-linked Plan: Widely known as TLP, this plan necessitates the payments to be made to the developer in pursuance of the predetermined payment schedule. Under this scheme of payment, the buyers are required to pay the portions of total price, irrespective of the development in the property. The schedule of payment is predetermined and is regardless to the stages of construction in a project. This payment plan generally fetches discounts for the customers. 
<br /><br />

3)  Down payment plan: A substantial amount of the total basic selling price is supposed to be paid to the developer at the time of booking under this scheme. The upfront payment (generally just about the entire amount) is what offers discounts for the customers owing to the developer receiving major chunk of the cost from the buyer in one go rather than being paid in installments under other plans. 
<br /><br />
4)  Possession linked plan: This plan entails the payments to be made in accord with the time periods assented in the agreement at the time of booking a property. For exemplification: It generally involves the payment of meager percentage of the total selling price at the time of booking and the next payment slots occur within 3 and 6 months from the date of booking. The payment slots occurring within 3 and 6 months from the date of booking requires 15 -20 percent to be paid in both the slots. The major chunk of 65% is to be paid at the time of possession of a property and therefore this payment plan is termed as a possession linked plan. 

<br /><br />
5)  Subvention plan: It is the latest payment scheme which is being adopted in the Indian real estate sector in the present day. For exemplification: This scheme enables the buyer to own a property with a mere 15 to 20 percent payment which is made at the time of booking a property. Moving forward, this scheme does not require the buyer to pay any PRE-EMIs for a fixed period of time which generally spans over 2 to 3 years or till the time of possession. After the booking of a property, the banking institutions disburse 80% cost of the asset to the developer and instead of the buyer, the developer pays for the PRE-EMIs (interest) to the lending institution on behalf of the buyer. The loan amount is approved/offered by the banks based upon the eligibility of the buyer and not the developer. The buyer is expected to begin paying off the loan amount only after the possession takes place. 
</p>
</div>


<div id="freehold_leasehold">
<h5>What is the difference between Freehold and Leasehold Property?</h5>
<p>
The major differences between these two types of properties come with their ownership and control. From a buyer’s perspective, a freehold property gives the right to its owner to make adjustments or recreate the property while abiding to the regional/local norms of housing and development authority. Unlike the leasehold property, the freehold property does not warrant any rental charge to be paid and the owner can retain the possession of such a property for the duration that the owner desires for. However, a leasehold property comes with the rights of possession for a stipulated period of time. The lease agreements generally span for over 30, 60, 99 or 999 years. Once the lease expires, the ownership/possession of the land is solely vested in the name of the lease holder. After the expiry of lease agreement, the buyer of a leasehold property has the options of either extending/renewing the lease agreement or purchasing the leasehold asset. While the buyer resides in the leasehold property, it is warranted for the buyer to pay an infrequent and low ground rental charge to the actual owner of the property.
